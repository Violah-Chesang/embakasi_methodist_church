                    <h1>Methodist Teachings:</h1>
                        <h4>All can be saved:</h4>
                        <p>Salvation is there for everyone who turns to God, and not just for a chosen few.</p>
                    </br>

                        <h4>Assurance of God’s love</h4>
                    
                        <p>“In the evening I went very unwillingly to a society at Aldersgate Street, where one was reading from Luther's preface to the Epistle to the Romans. About a quarter before nine, while he was describing the change that God works in the heart through faith in Christ, I felt my heart strangely warmed. I felt I did trust in Christ, Christ alone, for salvation. And an assurance was given me that he had taken away my sins, even mine, and saved me from the law of sin and death.” John Wesley.</p></br>
                        
                        <h4>Living a holy life:</h4>
                        <p>The longing for holiness is not about wanting to be 'holier than thou'. It is about wanting the love of God to permeate all of our life, and for that love to be shown through our lives to other people.</p>
                        </br>

                        <h4>Grass root movement:</h4>
                        <p>Ordinary people play a bigger part in evangelism and running of the church. Lay people share responsibility of running the church with the ordained ministers. They are involved in decision making about the church..</p>
                        <h4>Grass root movement</h4>
                                </br>
                        <h4>A covenant with God.</h4>
                        <p>Methodists hold an annual Covenant Service, at which we celebrate all that God has done for us, and affirm that we give our lives and choices to God as per the The Methodist Covenant Prayer.</p>
                    </br>

                        <h4>Born in song:</h4>
                        <p>we love to sing songs to learn and celebrate our faith to God our creator.</p>
                        
                        
                        <h4>Cell Groups/fellowships:</h4>
                        <p>Cell groups have proved to be the most effective means of maintaining among Methodist tru fellowship in Christian experience. Every member is required to associate with established cell groups within the church.</p>
                        
                            </br>
                        <h4>Reading of the Bible</h4>
                            
                        <p>Christians need to be familiar with the Bible and to immerse themselves in it. The Bible can be puzzling but it is continually a source of inspiration and direction in our lives.</p>
